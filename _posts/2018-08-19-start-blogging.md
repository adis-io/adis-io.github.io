title: Start blogging... again
---

Couple years ago I have used [blogger.com](http://osmonov.blogspot.com/) for blogging and hosting. There I shared my thoughts and tips. But it didn't work for me for a long time. Recently I've caught myself writing tips to myself in slack. So I decided to start blogging again and share posts with my friends and collegues.

I started searching a blog engine so stumbled upon Jekyll. I knew about this blog platform and I like writing markdowns. So I picked the popular theme [hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) as my basic theme, and customized the style a little bit.
